## Theme : 
Creating a brighter future for brain health by leveraging cutting-edge technology and compassionate care. Unleash the potential of AI to drive impactful solutions and foster a healthier tomorrow for all.

## Problem Statement:
The existing methods of diagnosing brain tumors through MRI scans often involve time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis by medical professionals. Additionally, there is a need for a secure and privacy-centric approach to handling sensitive patient data during the diagnostic process. The key points of the problem statement are as follows:

* **Manual MRI Analysis**: Current methods for diagnosing brain tumors using MRI scans rely heavily on manual analysis by medical experts. This process can be time-consuming, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment planning.
* **Accuracy and Efficiency**: There is a demand for a more accurate and efficient tumor identification process to enable early detection and timely intervention, which significantly impacts patient outcomes and survival rates.
* **Lack of Comprehensive Information**: Patients often receive limited information about their specific brain tumor type, its characteristics, potential risks, and treatment options. Providing comprehensive insights is essential for informed decision-making and patient empowerment.
* **Data Privacy Concerns**: With increasing concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare, there is a critical need to ensure that patient data, including MRI scans, is handled securely and not stored for privacy reasons.
* **Streamlining Appointment Booking**: The current process of booking appointments with specialized doctors can be cumbersome and inefficient. An integrated system that facilitates seamless appointment scheduling and communication is essential for patient convenience.
